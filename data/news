High Scorers
April 19, 2004
It sounds like some of you out there have become SolarWolf
fanatics. I've heard of beating the game with only 15 ships
used, and 26 skips. Amazing as my best is still only in the 40's.

March 10, 2004
Many people have noticed bugs in SolarWolf when turning the
music volume low or off. This will definitely be fixed in
the next release. Until then, enjoy the tunes.

A new Solarwolf is here, the best one yet. This version adds new

Now available for Windows and Mac OSX. Source works on just
about everything else.
